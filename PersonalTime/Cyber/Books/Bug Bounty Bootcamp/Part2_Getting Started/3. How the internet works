Client - Server relationship
Client requests for services and resources from Server.
Server provides services and resources to Client.

When visiting a website:
browser will be a client that request a webpage from web server.

Web page = collection of resources or files sent by the web server.
  HTML, CSS, JS, images, and videos
JavaScript can animate and validate user input on the client side before sending it to the server.
Web API enables applications to request data from other systems. Allowing data share and resources in a controlled way.

DNS server functions like a phone book, translating numbers to names or names to numbers.
So this is how it works:
Browser ---where is google.com--> DNS Server ---it's 8.8.8.8--> Browser
Then, Browser --Google please--> Web Server 8.8.8.8 --Here's the page--> Browser

Internet Ports
port is a logical division on devices that identifies the specific network service. 
  80 = http
  443 = https
  25 = SMTP
  22 = SSH
  21 = FTP
This feature allows the server to provide multiple services at the same time.
So, if the client connects to port 80, web server understeands that the client wishes to access its web services.
Browser(Client) --port 80--> WebServer <--> Port 80, Port 25, Port 21
