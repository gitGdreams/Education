Introduction to Ethical Hacking

InfoSec overview
=================

Elements of InfoSec
  Confidentiality - only for the eyes of authorized
  Integrity - can't change, check change with hash 
  Availability - accessible
  Authenticity - signed
  Non-Repudiation - can't deny

Motives, Goals and Objectives of InfoSec Attacks
  Attack = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability

Classification of Attacks
  Passive
  Active
  Close-In
  Insider
  Distribution

Information Warfare
  C2 warfare / Command and Control - possession over compromised system or network
  Intelligence-based - sensor-based
  Electronic - radio-electric
  Psychological - propaganda and terror
  Hacker -shutdowns, data errors,theft, and more using malware, virus, trojan, logic bombs, sniffers
  Economic - attacks economy of businesses; block flow of info
  Cyberwarfare - virtual personas; no harm, takes over; simula-warfare
  
    Forms of Infomation Warfare 
      Defensive - stat, actions to defend
      Offensive - ATTACK!!!!!!!


Hacking Methodologies and Framewarks
=====================================

CEH Hacking Methodology (CHM)
  Footprinting > Scanning > Enumeration > Vuln Analysis > System Hacking
                                                            Gaining Access - cracking passwords; Vuln exploitation
                                                            Escalating Privs
                                                            Maintaining Access - Excuting Apps; Hiding Files
                                                            Clearing logs - covering tracks

Cyber Kill Chain Methodology
  Recon > Weaponization > Delivery > Exploitation (Triggers code) > Installation (More malware coming up) > C2 > Actions on Objective (goal accomplished)
*Actions on Objectives can be access to confidential data, disrupts services or network, destroys operational capability, perform more attacks

TTPs - Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
  Tactics - operation of the threat actor
  Techniques - skills
  Procedures - Sequence of actions performed

Adversary Behavioral Identification
  - common methods used by adversary
  Internal Recon - 
  Use of powershell - automation 
  Unspecified Proxy Activities
  Use of Coomand-Line Interface - browse files; check process ID
  HTTP user Agent - user agent field
  C2 server - encrypted channel; check outbound connections, unwanted open ports
  Use of DNS Tunneling - to obfuscate malicious traffic; can communicate with C2 server; Analyze malicious DNS request
  Use of Web Shell - manipulate web server; analyze server access, error logs, sus strings
  Data Staging - collect and combine; net traffic, malicious file transfers, event logs

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
  Categories:
    Email - email
    Network - c2, malware delivery, operating systems, browser types; URLs, Domain names, IP address
    Host-based - filenames, file hashes, registries, DLLs, Mutex
    Behavioral - malicious IP, virus signatures, domain names
