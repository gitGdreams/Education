  Path traversal or directory traversal is a vulnerability that lets the hunter read arbitrary files
on the server that is running an application, including:
  application code and data
  back-end systems credentials
  sensitive operating system files

  In some cases, the hunter might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to
modify application data or behavior and ultimately take full control of the server.
