Path Traversal (Directory Traversal) Vulnerability

Definition:
Path traversal, also known as directory traversal, is a security vulnerability that 
allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server running the application.

Potential Exposures:
Application code and data
Back-end system credentials
Sensitive operating system files

Risk Escalation:
In certain scenarios, attackers may also write to arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to:
Modification of application data or behavior
Potential full control over the server
Key Points to Remember:

Path traversal vulnerabilities can expose critical information.
They pose a significant risk if attackers can write files, leading to possible server compromise.
Understanding and identifying path traversal vulnerabilities is crucial in ensuring the 
security of web applications. Stay vigilant and proactive in securing your systems!
